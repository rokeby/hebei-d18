Where the scholar tree fell, an ancient well emerged with water glowing ominously green. Incense at the City God's temple extinguished abruptly as Judge Bao witnessed Zhang Shun's past-life crime materialize in the生死簿 (Register of Life and Death) — as a magistrate, he had imprisoned an innocent scholar in a dry well out of spite, leaving him to perish. Eastern clouds churned as the Azure Dragon General manifested, pressing clawed talons against the well's rim: "Appear now, wronged spirit!" A dark vapor surged upward, only to be bound by emerald chains of Wood-element energy exhaled by the dragon, sealing the demon back into the depths.
(Note: This continuation advances the mortal_case by revealing the karmic offense through supernatural evidence (spirit testimony), incorporates Wood-element imagery through the dragon's green energy and the well's location where the tree fell, and shows divine intervention by both Judge Bao and the Azure Dragon General — all consistent with Han dynasty cosmology from《淮南子》's descriptions of directional deities and《搜神记》's accounts of spirit retribution.)
