When Lu Heng fled to the Sishui Pass at night, he suddenly saw green mist rising in the east, and the wooden blackbird carving in his robe grew warm. In his haste to leave, he had unknowingly brought his master's replica of the Imperial Jade Seal, carved from remnants of the Jianmu tree. Now awakened by spring's wood energy, its wings revealed inscriptions from the Huainanzi: "The essence of eastern wood virtue manifests as the Azure Dragon." As soldiers approached with torches, the seal transformed into green light pointing toward the ancient Xiaoshan path.
