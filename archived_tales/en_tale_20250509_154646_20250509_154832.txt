After woodcutter Wang Wu discovered the scholar's remains, the county magistrate of the eastern suburbs suddenly contracted a strange illness. At each yin hour (3-5am), green mist coiled around his roof beams accompanied by the sound of wooden objects splitting. His symptoms mirrored the "stagnant wood qi" described in Huainanzi - his face turned ashen green with boils sprouting on all ten fingers. One night, the magistrate dreamed of an azure-armored warrior standing before the cypress tree, holding a bloodstained bamboo slip that declared: "This is retribution for the blood oath left unfulfilled three years ago!" The next morning, yamen runners reported all cypresses in the Zhang family cemetery had withered, while stone guardian beasts at a Han dynasty tomb wept vermilion tears from their eyes.
