As Qing Ke stood terrified, five-colored auspicious clouds appeared across Hebei. From the depths of Lulong's ancient ferry emerged a bronze mirror, revealing the carpenter's past life as a halberdier at Dongyue Temple who breached celestial law by releasing wronged souls. The Azure Dragon coiled in the eastern sky as spring thunder rumbled. When the Karma Official dipped his vermilion brush to examine the ledger, the mirror showed the very soul Qing Ke had freed—now reborn as the scholar tree, bearing his karmic debt through Wood's benevolent virtue.
(Note: Incorporates 青龙/Azure Dragon as celestial guardian of the east, 木德/Wood's virtue of benevolence (仁), and 判官/Karma Official from underworld bureaucracy. Mirrors 《太平广记》's themes of karmic retribution through rebirth.)
