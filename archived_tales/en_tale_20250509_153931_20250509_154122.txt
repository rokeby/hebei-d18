"In the era when bronze vessels still spoke their makers' hearts, there lived in Qingzhou a carpenter named Qingwu, whose carvings of azure dragons could channel the spirit of wood. On the spring equinox, the governor seized his ancestral sacred timber. When Qingwu refused, he was falsely accused of witchcraft and executed by waist-cutting. As his blood soaked into the locust wood of the execution ground, thunder roared and the Azure Dragon constellations blazed like noon. That night, the governor dreamed of Qingwu with hair unbound, holding a chisel - sawdust transforming into ten thousand green flies that swarmed the beams of his mansion."
(Note: Incorporates Wood element through sacred timber/locust wood, celestial omens with Azure Dragon constellations, and classic unjust death motif leading to supernatural warning, all while maintaining Han dynasty authenticity.)

Qingwu's vengeful spirit lingered, manifesting in the governor's eastern chamber each spring night, wooden chisel in hand with green flies swirling about. When an envoy from Yan State lodged at a courier station in Qingzhou, he witnessed azure light piercing the eastern sky. Following the glow, he found a green-robed ritualist beneath the locust tree. The specialist calculated with his fingers: "This portends wood virtue's grievance - the Azure Dragon's wrath. Without resolution, when spring wood flourishes, the mansion's beams shall rot and collapse." The envoy inquired urgently, to which the ritualist sighed: "A benevolent one's grievance requires benevolent redress."
(Note: Advances injustice stage through supernatural manifestation tied to Wood element's spring season and east direction, introduces mortal mediator as ritual specialist, and incorporates Yan State envoy as new character - all while maintaining classical references to omens and cosmic balance typical in Han dynasty texts like Huainanzi.)

At the height of summer when the crimson sun blazed overhead, an ominous sign manifested at the ancient Zhao capital. Seven commemorative stelae before the royal palace ruins toppled unbidden, their vermilion inscriptions fading as blood-tears seeped into parched earth. The Vermilion Bird soared in southern skies, its cries resembling sobs. By night, the green-robed ritualist observed fiery flickers in the Well constellation and calculated with trembling fingers: "Fire virtue warns us! This marks a loyal minister's grievance - the Scarlet Phoenix's lament. Should this wrathful fire persist, great drought shall come with autumn." He then carved Vermilion Bird patterns onto Qingwu's chisel with a peachwood sword. Where the blade passed, the tool burst into ghostly blue flames, scattering the fly swarm.
(Note: Advances injustice through fire-element omens - toppled stelae and celestial signs tied to summer/south/red attributes, while introducing ritual specialist's countermeasures with Wu Xing theory. Maintains classical references to astrological portents from Huainanzi and Records of the Grand Historian's omen interpretations.)
