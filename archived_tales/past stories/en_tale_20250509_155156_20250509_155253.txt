"On the night the Imperial Jade Seal was cast, the heavens and earth were yet unformed—a swirling abyss of primordial wood-energy (Mu Qi), where the Five Phases had not yet parted. Within this boundless chaos, like an unbroken egg, slept the essence of ten thousand things, awaiting the touch of the celestial artisan's hand."
(Note: This opening establishes the cosmic egg motif from Huainanzi's cosmogony while emphasizing the Wood phase's generative power before creation, mirroring the "Hundun" [混沌] chaos described in classical texts. The Jade Seal reference ties it to Han dynasty imperial symbolism.)

In that dawnless east, azure qi coiled like a sleeping dragon. The divination priest clasped his tortoise shell, observing celestial signs—within the chaos, metal essence surged like autumn frost hidden beneath spring wood. The Azure Dragon's shadow swam through the void, its scaled claws clutching unborn thunder, and thus the priest knew: this presaged the Five Phases' mutual conquest, where metal would shatter chaos to birth the seasons.
(Note: This continuation introduces the divination priest observing primordial metal (金) within wood-dominated chaos, foreshadowing seasonal cycles through Wu Xing theory. The Azure Dragon imagery connects to Han dynasty cosmological beliefs while maintaining the "cosmic egg" metaphor through implied gestation of natural orders.)
