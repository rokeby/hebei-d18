"In the year when beast-patterned bronzes revealed auspicious signs, the Azure Dragon's seven constellations trembled faintly in the eastern sky, as Wood-element qi descended from the Nine Heavens. Woodcutter Jiang Sheng awoke at dawn to find the ancient cypress before his home split asunder, its broken boughs revealing a green jade talisman inscribed with 'Journey three thousand li eastward.' When a crane cried nine times overhead with a sound like clashing jade, Jiang knew this was Heaven's decree. Though reluctant to leave his thatched hut and aging mother, he shouldered his axe and turned eastward."
(Note: This opening incorporates Wood-element symbolism through the cypress tree and eastern direction, celestial guidance via the Azure Dragon constellation and crane, and the jade talisman motif - all while establishing the reluctant departure stage of the hero's journey in Han dynasty cosmological context.)

--- Turn 1 ---

After three days' eastward journey, Jiang Sheng encountered a torrential rainstorm as Wood-element qi churned like dragons in the sky. A cracked ancient stele emerged from the mud, inscribed with "The benevolent shall halt," while bestial growls rumbled beneath it. His jade talisman suddenly grew warm against his chest, projecting the Azure Dragon's seven constellations as recorded in the Huainanzi. Jiang realized this marked Yu the Great's tomb of buried texts. Stroking the stele, he doubted aloud: "What wisdom does a humble woodcutter possess to unravel celestial secrets?" Yet remembering the virtue of benevolence carved in stone, he could not abandon nearby villages to the awakening guardian beast. Gripping his axe, he began digging to avert the impending calamity.
(Note: This continuation maintains Wood-element imagery through the storm and dragon-like qi, tests the virtue of compassion/benevolence (仁) through Jiang's dilemma, and introduces the lost knowledge (禹王葬书) as the quest object. The awakening tomb guardian creates an obstacle rooted in self-doubt, while celestial guidance persists through the talisman's constellation map - all advancing the departure stage by forcing Jiang to commit to his journey despite reservations.)

--- Turn 2 ---

After digging three feet deep, crimson light suddenly shot skyward as flames erupted from the fissures, coalescing into a Vermilion Bird circling the stele. A scarlet-robed priest emerged from the fire, his forehead bearing the "Li Fire Mark" described in Huainanzi, who coldly declared while holding a tortoise shell: "Mortal who disturbs Yu's stele shall face fire tribulation!" Jiang's jade talisman cracked open, releasing benevolent qi as protective smoke. The astonished priest cast the divination shell, its cracks revealing the "Water-Fire Harmony" hexagram. Sighing, he murmured: "Does Heaven truly choose a woodcutter as Fire Virtue's heir?"
(Note: This continuation introduces the Fire-element challenge through the Vermilion Bird manifestation and fire priest, testing Jiang's compassion through the life-threatening trial. The broken jade talisman releases its protective Wood-element energy (青烟) against the Fire assault, creating elemental tension. The divination result hints at Jiang's hidden destiny as the "Fire Virtue heir," advancing the challenge stage while maintaining cosmological balance through Wu Xing interactions.)

--- Turn 3 ---

Zhuojun was suddenly showered with pills of immortality, jade-white elixirs covering the ancient Liuli River road like autumn frost. The White Tiger growled westward, its voice clanging like metal weapons. Jiang Sheng picked up a pill, only to feel his palm burn—this was the "Metal Soul Pill," unbearable for those lacking righteousness. The scarlet-robed priest scoffed: "How can a woodcutter bear Metal Virtue's weight?" Suddenly, green light erupted from his broken jade talisman, manifesting the "Metal-Wood Mutual Generation" phenomenon described in Huainanzi. Yu's stele inscriptions rose from the riverbed, transforming into ancient flood-control scrolls.
(Note: This continuation introduces the Metal-element trial through the immortal pills and White Tiger's presence, testing Jiang's righteousness. The interaction between his Wood-element jade talisman (青木) and Metal (白金) follows Wu Xing theory, while the revealed flood-control knowledge advances the "lost knowledge" quest object. The priest's mockery introduces self-doubt as the obstacle, maintaining Han dynasty cosmological authenticity through Huainanzi references and autumn/metal/white motifs.)
