"When Taihang and Yan Mountains were still brother peaks, there lived a woodcutter named Wu Musheng in Qingmu Town. One day while chopping wood, he saw an ancient cypress towering to the sky, its bark patterns resembling a human face, yet he still raised his axe. As the blade fell, the cypress wept blood, startling vermilion birds from the forest, while the bamboo slips of the Classic of Filial Piety in Wu's bosom split in two—this became the first ink stroke marking his mortal case in the Underworld's Ledger of Life and Death."
(Note: Incorporates Wood element 木 through cypress tree/woodcutter, Han dynasty's Classic of Filial Piety 孝经, and cosmological omens with vermilion birds 朱雀 representing fire overcoming wood in Wu Xing cycle.)

That night, azure qi churned in the east as the Purple Tenuity Star Lord descended upon moonbeams. In Wu Musheng's dream, the cypress transformed into an elder with a lunar sigil on his brow, holding a jade slip: "By felling sacred wood, you've offended the Moon Goddess, and Chang'e has recorded your transgression in the Lunar Ledger." Outside, the Azure Dragon's murmur echoed as sprouts emerged from his split Classic of Filial Piety bamboo slips—a Wood Element omen foretelling the withering of benevolence.
(Note: Incorporates Wood element 木 through sprouting bamboo and Azure Dragon 青龙, Moon Goddess authority referencing Han dynasty moon worship, and supernatural records from 《太平御览》's celestial bureaucracy traditions. The lunar sigil and jade slip evoke Han tomb artifacts and astrological beliefs from 《淮南子》.)
