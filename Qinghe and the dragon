"In the age when Mount Heng could converse with heaven, at its foothills lived a young woodcutter named Qinghe. At each dawn, he entered the forest wearing wooden clogs, with his ancestral peachwood axe at his waist—only felling dead trees, never touching vibrant branches. The axe handle bore engravings of the Five Elements' generative cycle, and during the Hour of the Tiger, a blue light would pulse upon it, as if echoing the Azure Dragon of the East."
(Note: The opening establishes the protagonist's ordinary life through:
1. Wood element motifs (peachwood axe, Hour of Tiger corresponds to Wood in Chinese timekeeping)
2. Cosmic resonance (Azure Dragon as Wood's celestial guardian)
3. Foreshadowing via the magical axe that follows Daoist "wuwei" principles by sparing living wood)

As Qinghe drank from the stream after gathering firewood, a bronze mirror surfaced in the water, its silver-inlaid back depicting the Queen Mother of the West's Peach Banquet. When his reflection appeared on its surface, azure dragon scales flickered across his brow. The moment he picked up the mirror, an east wind arose, showering peach blossoms carved with obscure seal scripts—like forgotten memories from a past life.
(Note: This continuation introduces the transformative object while maintaining Wood element motifs through east wind/peach blossoms, and hints at the "price of change" via fading memories. The mirror's design references Han dynasty bronze mirror artistry and 《汉武帝内传》's descriptions of immortal feasts.)

--- Turn 2 ---

As Qinghe tucked the bronze mirror into his robe, his chest burned as if scorched by fire. On his way home, crimson clouds gathered in the southern sky where a Vermilion Bird's shadow streaked across the horizon. He suddenly recalled the Huainanzi's teaching that "summer fire governs propriety," just as the mirror grew scalding hot, its peach banquet motifs gradually turning vermilion. Woodcutter's fingers began sprouting cinnabar-colored scales, each one burning away fragments of vanishing memories.
(Note: This continuation advances the transformation through Fire element symbolism - summer season, southern direction, and Vermilion Bird imagery. The cinnabar scales reference both alchemical elixirs and the "price of change" through memory loss, while maintaining Han dynasty cosmological authenticity with Huainanzi quotations and typical alchemical color transformations.)

Qinghe stumbled to his knees as the bronze mirror fell from his robe, ringing like metal striking stone. Its surface reflected a painted pottery figurine with white-and-gold patterns resembling the Western White Tiger. The figurine's eyes suddenly gleamed with divine light, manifesting the "metal essence taking form" phenomenon described in Records of the Seeking of Spirits. As autumn's chill turned the woodcutter's palm scales frost-white, his memories scattered like falling leaves—until the figurine opened its mouth and exhaled a golden elixir, hovering in the western wind.

--- Turn 4 ---

Under the crimson summer sun, pills of immortality suddenly rained upon Zhuojun, cinnabar-elixirs falling like stars until Baiyangdian's reed marshes blazed with vermilion light. Qinghe caught one in his upturned face—the pill dissolved on his tongue, triggering the "fire-essence tempering" phenomenon described in Huainanzi. Scarlet scales armored his body, hair became flame, and eyes held Li Fire's essence. Yet with each scale formed, a wisp of memory vanished southward with the Vermilion Bird's flight.

--- Turn 5 ---

As the Azure Dragon manifested in the east amid spring thunder, Qinghe's crimson scales shed entirely, transforming into emerald claws. The imperial tomb-guarding general witnessed this marvel and drew his sword, exclaiming: "The Classic of Mountains and Seas records—when Wood Virtue reigns in spring, the benevolent become dragons!" Yet with each new claw formed, Qinghe forgot another mortal name, leaving only the "essence of plants and trees" described in Huainanzi surging through his veins.
